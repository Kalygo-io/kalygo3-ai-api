Ollama is a tool that allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your own machine. This means you can use powerful AI models without needing to send your data to external servers, ensuring complete privacy and control over your interactions.

## Key Benefits

1. **Privacy**: All your interactions with the model stay on your local machine
2. **Control**: You have complete control over the model weights and can audit them with 100% certainty
3. **Performance**: For many use cases, local models can perform on par with cloud-based solutions
4. **Cost**: No ongoing API costs once you have the model downloaded

## Installation

To get started with Ollama, visit the official website at ollama.com and download the appropriate version for your operating system. The installation process is straightforward and includes a simple wizard to guide you through the setup.

## Usage

Once installed, you can interact with Ollama through the command line interface. The tool supports a wide variety of models, each with different capabilities and resource requirements. You can start and stop the Ollama service through the menu bar icon on macOS.

## Supported Models

Ollama supports many popular models including:
- Llama 2
- Mistral
- Code Llama
- And many more

Each model has different characteristics and is suited for different tasks. The Ollama GitHub repository provides a comprehensive table showing the most commonly used models and their IDs.
